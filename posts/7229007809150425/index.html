This component is necessary to create and maintain new cells in a healthy state, therefore its presence is especially important during periods of rapid development of the body, especially in early childhood.  So, if you want, feel free to eat watermelons: when breastfeeding, they will be useful even to the baby.  As for the mother, folic acid gives her a beautiful and even complexion, as well as youth. </p><p>  Large berries contain another important component that allows you to cleanse the body of harmful substances, including toxins.  This is panthenolic acid.  The substance is able to normalize sleep.  This is important not only for the mother, but also for the child. </p><p>  In general, watermelons are very useful for breastfeeding.  After all, they allow you to normalize the water balance in the mother's body.  These berries help to remove edema that remains after childbirth, remove excess fluid, increase the frequency of urination, and also contribute to better production of breast milk. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to breast-feed a watermelon?" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1402359.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><h2>  What time to enter </h2><p>  As practice shows, you can watermelon while breastfeeding all mothers.  The main thing is to correctly enter it into the diet.  It is not recommended to start eating melons earlier than three months after the appearance of breast milk.  In the first 60 days, a young mother should adhere to a strict diet.  This will allow the child to get used to the new diet and learn to perceive the nutritional components obtained with milk.  Starting from 4 months a woman can diversify her menu. </p><p>  A new product should be introduced gradually.  In this case, the portions should be small.  After 5 days, the amount of product can be increased.  In this case, it is necessary to carefully monitor the condition of the child.  If his stomach is sick or a rash appears, then it is worth giving up watermelons. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Breastfeeding for a newborn" class="if" height="307" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1402430.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><h2>  Watermelon Allergy </h2><p>  Despite its clear <span>benefits, watermelon</span> while breastfeeding a newborn can cause trouble.  The composition of this berry is unique.  However, the product belongs to the strongest food allergens.  Therefore, you should use watermelons with extreme caution. </p><p>  If the mother has even a slight allergy to this product, you should refuse it.  Signs of such a malaise may also appear in the baby.  If the child has diathesis, watermelons should immediately be excluded from the mother's menu.  The reaction cannot be fixed.  Otherwise, it will become chronic.  It is also important to properly neutralize the consequences. </p><p>  After some time, you can try the watermelon again.  Perhaps the problem arose due to the unformed immunity of the child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Is it possible to watermelon while breastfeeding a newborn" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/21029/1402360.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><h2>  Digestion problems </h2><p>  Watermelon should be consumed in limited quantities.  Otherwise, a slight upset may occur.  You should eat watermelons only after the main meal and a little.  After all, the mother‚Äôs stomach may be overloaded.  As a result, unpleasant sensations, severity and increased gas formation may appear. </p><p>  The child may also experience discomfort.  As a result of excessive consumption by the mother of the watermelon pulp, the baby may be disturbed by colic.  It is for this reason that these berries should be eaten in small portions.  You can increase the amount of watermelon only in cases where the product does not cause digestive problems. </p><h2>  Possible poisoning </h2><p>  Is it possible to unlimited watermelon while breastfeeding a newborn?  Of course not.  The main danger of such a berry is that, as a result of the wrong choice, it can cause severe poisoning not only in the mother, but also in the child.  Do not forget that watermelons contain a large amount of nitrates.  These substances allow fruits to ripen much faster.  After consuming such foods, both the mother and the child may suffer.  After all, chemicals are stored in berries, and also easily penetrate into breast milk.  In addition, the children's body is more susceptible to the effects of certain substances.  If a small amount of nitrates may not affect the mother‚Äôs health and well-being at all, then even a fraction of them can be dangerous for a child. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="breastfeeding watermelon in the first month" class="if" height="337" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1402433.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><h2>  When not to eat watermelons </h2><p>  First of all, you can not eat watermelon while breastfeeding in the first month of lactation.  It is very dangerous for a newborn baby.  In addition, there are a number of diseases in which the use of such food is not allowed.  First of all, women with diabetes should be abandoned watermelons.  In principle, they are forbidden such food. </p><p>  Also, it is worth giving up melons for those who have problems with the excretory system.  These may be kidney stones.  Watermelons can also aggravate the state of health in the presence of pancreatic diseases.  Before introducing such a product into the diet, consult a doctor. </p><h2>  How to avoid trouble </h2><p>  So, watermelons during breastfeeding are quite acceptable, but we should not forget that these fruits can cause poisoning, allergies and other unpleasant phenomena.  To avoid this, you must choose the right product.  Do not forget that watermelons ripen only at the beginning of autumn.  You should not buy melons in the spring and even in the middle of summer.  Similar products can be poisoned with nitrates.  It is also not recommended to eat unripe watermelons. </p><p>  Acquire the fruits should only be whole, without cracks and cuts.  You should also choose those berries that do not lie on the ground, but in special trays.  You should not buy watermelons that are sold along the roads. </p><p></p></div></article>
