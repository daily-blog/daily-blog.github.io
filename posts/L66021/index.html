<h1>Moles on the hands, on the fingers: meaning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  There are no moles on the skin of newborn babies.  This is because in infants, sensitivity to sunlight is undeveloped.  As it grows older, it accordingly increases, as a result of which formations appear on all parts of the body.  From the point of view of medicine, these are ordinary clusters of cells responsible for the color of the epidermis - myelocytes.  Palmistry interprets these formations as signs of fate and certain manifestations of <span>a person‚Äôs character.</span> </p><h2>  What it is? </h2><p>  Any moles on the hands, on the fingers, face or hips are information on which you can read events in life.  Marks are sometimes inherited through centuries and generations, but in most cases they appear in an exceptional order for each individual.  Palmists say that very large formations are the imprint of an important, significant event from a past life.  As the mole grows, it can be judged that the problem has not been resolved, and its karmic energy has left a mark on the human body.  If, on the contrary, it decreases, then the individual lives correctly: on a subconscious level, he does things that lead to the finish of a thing that is not completed in the previous incarnation. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moles on fingers" class="if" height="246" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843698.jpg" width="500"></div><p></p><p>  There is also such an opinion: moles are a kind of bioenergy antennas that perceive and filter information.  Another interesting psychological theory is that these are marks of serious injuries and injuries experienced in past incarnations.  Therefore, they can hurt and bleed, as well as cause discomfort and provoke the appearance of fear. </p><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><h2>  A few historical facts </h2><p>  It is interesting, but people have always interpreted the formations on the face and legs in different ways, the moles on the <span>fingers.</span>  The meaning changed depending on the era: for example, in medieval Europe, they were considered devilish signs.  The person noted by Satan himself was usually threatened with burning at the stake.  True, after several centuries, moles were dubbed the symbols of beauty.  Ladies often glued artificial flies on their faces, considering them a manifestation of coquetry and mystery. </p><p>  Unlike Europeans, representatives of Asia had their own point of view.  In their opinion, the more moles a person had, the more rich his <span>inner world was.</span>  An individual without markings did not possess a soul and was a representative of dark forces. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moles on the fingers meaning" class="if" height="322" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/844008.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  Palmists, who have always tried to interpret the meaning of the formations, have chosen the Greek Melamp as the patron saint.  This ancient philosopher, in his treatises, tried to explain what the signs on the cheeks, feet or back, moles on the fingers, or on the back of the head portend to a person.  In this case, it was especially important on which side of the body they are.  It is conditionally divided into two parts: left - female, right - male.  Therefore, for boys and girls, the sign that appeared on their half was considered favorable. </p><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><h2>  Moles on the palms </h2><p>  They can appear both from the back and from the inside.  Love and happiness, sorrows and failures promise moles in the arms.  On the fingers, their meaning is one, on the palms - another.  For example, if you are the owner of education on the left hand, then expect great success in life.  The spot on the left palm is a sign of great luck, only if it touches the line of life, then expect troubles or difficulties in achieving the goal.  A similar interpretation applies to the right hand.  The education located here portends life's achievements, the fulfillment of dreams. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mole on the finger of the left hand" class="if" height="387" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843684.jpg" width="592"></div><p></p><p>  When there are many moles, and they are scattered in a string all over the palm of your hand, this means that you have a rather difficult character.  You like to brawl, get involved in conflicts.  The nature of such a <span>person is unpredictable</span> and contradictory.  People with a moderate number of marks, more balanced.  But the lonely spot (no matter in which palm) is a sign of fortitude, determination, generosity, prosperity and fidelity.  On the hands of men, moles symbolize a natural gift that will surely lead them to success. </p><h2>  The color of moles, their location on the fingers </h2><p>  Different colors are marked on the hands.  <span>Red moles</span> are associated with Jupiter - the planet that controls actions and events that relate to law, power, authority, beliefs and religion.  Such spots need to be especially meticulously studied, since they warn of a new worldview and events that make a person change ideologically.  Light moles on the hands (on the fingers) indicate the influence of Venus: they indicate the affection, feelings of the individual, his impact on the environment.  But yellow-brown formations say that you need to work hard to achieve a result. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mole on the ring finger" class="if" height="433" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843995.jpg" width="595"></div><p></p><p>  Moles of any color located on the outside of the fingers are not considered a very good sign.  Most likely, a person‚Äôs life will be filled with disappointments and negative feelings.  Depending on the exact location, the spots predict breaks in friendships and family relationships.  But moles on the inside of the fingers are a favorable sign.  Usually they promise their owner happiness and luck. </p><h2>  On the index and middle fingers </h2><p>  Let's see what these marks mean.  Palmists claim that moles on the index finger are considered signs of nobility and ambition.  Such people value family and nature, believe in their actions, always take responsibility.  The ‚Äúmarked‚Äù index finger indicates that we have a born leader, an intelligent and reasonable person, whose weakness is moralizing and commanding.  A mole on the right phalanx promises men a measured and calm life, women - a significant position in society.  If the spot is visible on the finger of the left hand, then for representatives of the stronger sex it is a symbol of toughness and aggressiveness, for their other halves - an arrogant attitude towards people and a penchant for religion. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moles on the index finger" class="if" height="445" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843707.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  As for the middle phalanx, it is under the auspices of Saturn.  Moles on the fingers have a different meaning in this case - they signal a dictatorial stock of character, but at the same time justice and honesty.  Such people always strive to be in the center of the company; they crave attention and even worship.  A mole on the inside of the phalanx promises a materially secure life. </p><h2>  Big fingers </h2><p>  Marks on these phalanges indicate that you are very popular among members of the opposite sex.  You are loved and appreciated, surrounded by care and affection.  However, such people should be careful when solving financial problems, as there is a tendency to loss of money, bankruptcy, unprofitable investment. </p><p>  A mole on the finger of the left hand is an unfavorable sign for men.  Usually such a mark portends a disease, a need, and sometimes a whole series of troubles.  Problems can concern both personal life and the business sphere.  If a person manages to overcome difficulties, he will spend the rest of his life in peace and prosperity.  It is interesting that for women, the spot on the left thumb predicts good events: a strong marriage, a stable financial situation, and health.  If the fly is on the right phalanx, then the girl, on the contrary, needs to be wary of an unsuccessful personal life.  Such a lady is a restless and unstable nature.  But for men, the right thumb marked by fate guarantees a high position in society, authority and strong ties. </p><h2>  Unnamed fingers </h2><p>  On these phalanges it is undesirable to have marks.  A mole on the ring finger is a sign of frequent depression and failure.  People who have it will constantly suffer from disappointment, lack of elementary joy and well-being.  A stain on the phalanx of the left hand promises members of the stronger sex family problems or alcohol abuse.  Their fate will not be easy.  But for women, such a mole portends happiness in family relationships, a measured life, respect from others.  Interpretation of the mark on the nameless phalanx of the right hand is necessary exactly the opposite for representatives of both sexes. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="mole on the finger of the right hand" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843994.jpg" width="579"></div><p></p><p>  Moles on the hands, fingers and palms change value depending on the exact location.  For example, if a spot is located at the base of the ring finger on the outside of the palm of the hand, then this means frequent sorrows that a person will encounter on the path of life.  Such people have a pronounced predisposition to divorce.  Palmists advise wearing a ring so that it covers the mole.  This will help protect a person from quarrels and scandals.  It is interesting that people who have such a mark on the ring finger have amazing sleight of hand, so they make excellent needlewomen or magicians. </p><h2>  Little moles on the little fingers </h2><p>  Marks on the smallest phalanges characterize a person as frivolous and talkative.  He often does not keep his promises, which is why he has various troubles at work and at home.  A mole on the finger of the right hand promises men a stable family, financial and social position, as well as a penchant for betrayal, risk, and gambling;  women mole promises excessive sensitivity and emotionality, good marriage and the availability of material wealth. </p><p></p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="moles on the fingers" class="if" height="449" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/23745/843993.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  A mole on the left little finger promises the representatives of the stronger sex a lot of unjustified monetary waste.  The lack of a sober look and practical ingenuity prevents him from getting rich and achieving a high career position.  He also shines divorces and discord in personal relationships.  But for girls, this mark portends success in love, at work and with friends.  She will surely live a happy life and die a wealthy old woman.  Also, education on the little finger indicates that a person has a penchant for sales.  He can become a successful manager or businessman. </p><p></p></div></article>
