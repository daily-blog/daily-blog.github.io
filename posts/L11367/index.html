<h1>What happens if you eat cucumber with milk? Are these products compatible?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  All of you have probably heard about separate nutrition, compatible products and absolute antagonists.  For example, meat and chips are a very difficult combination.  At the same time, cabbage with meat is perfectly digested, they complement each other.  But there are more exotic couples.  For example, many since childhood have been tormented by the question, what happens if you eat a cucumber with milk?  Let's try to find the answer together. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.searchherbalremedy.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="if you eat pickled cucumber with milk" class="if uuid-2493527" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2493527.jpg"></div><h2>  All individually </h2><p>  Just want to note this point.  All organisms are different, and the sensitivity of the digestive tract, too.  No wonder it happens that the whole family eats one dish, and one has a stomach ache by the evening.  No, the food was not of poor quality.  Just for the body, the combination of products turned out to be inappropriate. </p><p>  Today we decided to discuss what will happen if we eat cucumber with milk.  There are many myths about this.  There are many people who claim that they completely drank crunchy vegetables with milk and felt great.  Who is right, let's understand. </p><h2>  Fresh vegetables with milk </h2><p>  In the summer, an abundance of crispy cucumbers leads to the fact that crispy greens become a favorite addition to any dish.  And instead of a snack, it also fits perfectly.  But what about milk tea, which completes almost every meal?  Often, right after a tea party, a person begins to frantically remember what will happen if you eat a cucumber with milk?  Most likely, in such a combination, there will be nothing terrible with you.  Therefore, calm down and continue in the same spirit. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.natural-homeremedies.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what to do if ate a cucumber with milk" class="if uuid-2493529" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2493529.jpg"></div><h2>  Fresh vegetables with sour milk </h2><p>  This question is also raised quite often, so we will pay a little attention to it.  If the thematic forums describe in sufficient detail what will happen if you eat cucumber with milk, then about kefir and yogurt is somehow silent.  We recall the usual summer okroshka, which many fill in with serum.  Well, some eat it with kefir.  It is delicious and very healthy.  And no one complains about the colorfully described indigestion.  It turns out that the harmful properties of this pair do not work if milk is replaced with a sour-milk analogue. </p><h2>  Discharge dish </h2><p>  There is a Greek dish, which is very popular on hot days when there is no appetite.  For cooking, you need to take a glass of low-fat kefir or yogurt.  Cut a cucumber, add a clove of garlic and some favorite greens.  Beat and eat with a spoon.  You can add crackers.  An excellent evening meal for those who want to lose weight.  It is tasty and contains no calories. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.allrecipes.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what will happen if the cucumber is washed down with milk" class="if uuid-2493536" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2493536.jpg"></div><h2>  Pickle </h2><p>  As for the combination of fresh vegetables and dairy products, everything seems to be clear.  Opinions are divided, but most of those who have tried them together argue that nothing bad will happen.  Usually there is not even increased bloating, especially if you do not have a tendency to this.  And what will happen if you eat pickled cucumber with milk? </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><p>  Despite all the warnings, there are many examples when people tolerated this combination of products quite normally.  It turns out to be more "explosive" than previous options.  But if tomorrow you do not have an important meeting and you stay at home, then you can take a chance.  The reaction is individual, therefore it is impossible to predict it.  For one, such a set of products will result in severe diarrhea.  Another will note excessive flatulence.  The third one does not even notice deviations in the digestive process.  Before you think what to do if you ate a cucumber with milk, you should watch your feelings a little.  It is possible that you do not even feel the unpleasant symptoms that are so scary. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.culturehook.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="what will happen if you eat cucumber with milk" class="if uuid-2493523" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2493523.jpg"></div><h2>  Why is this duet undesirable </h2><p>  As we have said, there are products that are incompatible with each other.  Pickled cucumbers with milk belong to such a duet.  Together, they can cause severe poisoning.  Therefore, no matter how you are drawn to experiments, it is better to abandon them.  Pickled cucumbers with milk do not get along well with each other.  Cucumber increases the acidity of the stomach, and milk in this case instantly coagulates.  That's why with kefir, this product is perceived by the body much easier. </p><p>  Fresh milk by an adult is generally quite difficult to digest, so it should be consumed solely as a separate product.  It is better to do this in the morning, adding a glass of milk toast or bread.  But sour cream or kefir with vegetables combines very well, we have already talked about this before. </p><h2>  What will be </h2><p>  We usually think about this after we got up from the table.  What will happen if the cucumber is washed down with milk, we begin to ask, and someone even calls the doctor.  It‚Äôs almost impossible to say exactly how your body will react.  But if you are worried about a violent reaction, then try to prevent it.  For this, you can immediately take the sorbents.  This is Polysorb or activated carbon.  The drugs will bind toxins, and the body will more easily tolerate the effects of this ‚Äúsweet couple‚Äù. </p><p>  Two hours after the sorbents, you can take two capsules "Linex" in order to avoid unpleasant consequences.  And if there is an important meeting or meeting ahead, it is recommended to drink the Loperamide capsule.  This drug blocks diarrhea and allows you to live a peaceful life until you get home. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.justalittlebitofbacon.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="cucumber with milk" class="if uuid-2493538" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/18979/2493538.jpg"></div><h2>  Instead of a conclusion </h2><p>  Both of these products - both milk and cucumbers - are healthy and tasty.  But taking risks and consuming them together, especially in large quantities, is not worth it.  If after a salad with a cucumber you drink tea with milk, then you can be calm.  But crunching pickles and sipping milk is not too reasonable.  Better to pause between these products.  Just a few hours break, and you can be calm. </p><p></p></div></article>
