characteristics of <span>this socket indicated the presence of 775 contacts and the possibility of installing processor solutions, which included 1, 2, or even 4 computing cores.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Intel, as opposed to AMD, never had an intermediate version with 3 code processing blocks.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>It should also be noted that this processor socket is sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúSocket T‚Äù.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The system logic chipset in this case included 2 elements: the 945</span> <span><span>CG</span></span> <span><span>Northbridge and ICH7 Southbridge.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>This chipset was officially introduced in 2007.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Its semiconductor

enough.</span></span></span>  <span><span><span>Also, he could easily cope with browsing websites, playing videos and listening to music.</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>Budget computers within this platform could be based on <span>Pentium DualCore, Pentium</span> 4 or <span>Pentium D</span> line CPUs <span>.</span> Improved architecture and increased clock speeds allowed these CPUs to already demonstrate decent results in game tests.</span></span></span> </p></li><li><p>  <span><span><span>Even faster and at the same time energy-efficient processor solutions were chips of the <span>Core 2Duo</span> series <span>.</span></span></span></span>  <span><span><span>The more advanced architecture of the semiconductor chip, even higher frequencies and a larger cache size were the factors that allowed these processors to come close in performance and speed to the flagship solutions of this platform.</span></span></span>
