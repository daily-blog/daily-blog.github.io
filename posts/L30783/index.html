<h1>Anton Lissov: biography, photo</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Anton Lissov was born in St. Petersburg on August 17, 1979.  In 1996 he graduated from gymnasium No. 168. Information about higher education is not indicated on the official pages of the musician, but it is known that for some time the guy worked as a designer.  Now known as a musician (project Jane Air). </p><h2>  Biography </h2><p>  So, our today's hero is Anton Lissov.  His biography will be discussed in detail below.  The musician is also known as Boo (Boo!) Or Burza (through the efforts of fans, of course) - the permanent leader, lyricist and vocalist of the famous alternative band Jane Air.  At the moment, the collective continues concert activity;  in 2014, with the support of the crowdfunding portal Planeta.ru, the album "Black Harbor" was recorded, the presentation of the album took place in November of the same year in St. Petersburg.  Among other musical achievements of Bu and his comrades, it should be noted the opening acts of such foreign metal monsters as well-known hooligans Linkin Park, melodic Swedes Clawfinger - now, unfortunately, gone into musical oblivion - and Therapy from the north of Ireland. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anton Liss married" class="if" height="342" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1331160.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  Now you know what tremendous success Anton (Boo) Lissov managed to achieve.  At the same time, his biography was not much different from the life stories of other Petersburgers until 1999, which in a sense became a turning point in his life and career.  It was then that the indie alternative music group Jane Air was formed, where Lissov, who took the pseudonym Boo, is a songwriter and vocalist.  In addition to Boo, the group includes Sergey (Koren) Grigoryev (guitar), bassist Gokk <span>(Sergey Makarov)</span> and Anton Sagachko - drummer.  At the dawn of 2001, on January 1, the group gave their first solo album in the St. Petersburg club "Milk", which later became almost a cult place - annually Jane Air organize a traditional private concert there only for friends. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  In 2002, their debut album, Pull Ya Let It Doll Go!  in collaboration with the independent record company Cap-Kan, with which the group will enter into close partnership.  The hit was the song Junk - a kind of visiting card of the band, which was soon released a clip. </p><p>  In 2004, the formation delights fans with the Junk single and studio album.  He bears the same name with the name of the group - Jane Air.  In October of the same year, a large-scale concert tour in Russia was appointed - Screamin &amp; Growlin.  2005 was marked by the Junk hit award from the famous A-One channel in the "Song of the Year" category, and the group also became the sales leader of the Cap-Kan label, which released along with Jane Air records and other independent groups that make up the solid backbone of the St. Petersburg alternative music: "The Last Tanks In Paris", Amatory and so on. </p><p>  The following year, Anton Lissov and the company will release the first DVD, which includes concert recordings and a video for the song ‚ÄúParis‚Äù, as well as a live disc from the played concerts of the year. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anton Liss photo" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/1330893.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  The year 2006 was spent in a foreign mini-tour - the musicians visited Finland, delighting foreign fans with the support of the fervent Finns Killpretty.  However, work on the new album does not stop: April of the same year was marked by the presentation of ‚ÄúPere-Lachaise: Love and a little Death‚Äù, and three video clips for the compositions from the new album were shot. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><p>  In 2007, a landmark, as is commonly believed, for emo culture, Jane Air changes its label and goes under the wing of A-One Records, which, of course, indicates the growing popularity of the group.  Boo is recording a new album - Sex and Violence, perhaps the most famous of the entire discography due to its gothic-mystical filling.  The song ‚ÄúThe Bride‚Äù, which was shot in the spirit of the classic horror, became a definite hit: gloomy landscapes, a dead bride, accompanied by a retinue of decomposed corpses - an absolute triumph of necro-aesthetics.  The next year was marked by another award - Fuzz.  This time in the nomination "Best Album". </p><h2>  Hospitalization </h2><p>  Touring activities of the group were suspended until March.  According to news from the fan community, after a concert in Tallinn, the group leader Anton Lissov was hospitalized.  The reason for hospitalization was not disclosed either in the official community or in online publications.  According to unverified data, the diagnosis is "an acute attack of appendicitis." </p><h2>  "The illusion of flight" </h2><p>  In 2010, Anton (Boo!) Lissov and his companions made fans happy with the full-blown Weekend Warriors double with a total duration of almost an hour and a half.  Two years later, in 2012, the group actively collaborates with other alternatives.  The fruits of co-creation were included in the album ‚ÄúThe Illusion of Flight‚Äù, which also has three clips. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anton liss" class="if" height="481" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1331215.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><h2>  northern capital </h2><p>  Another two-year break, and Jane Air present the Black Harbor to the grateful public - as Anton Lissov said, it was decided to make the album ‚Äúabsolutely St. Petersburg‚Äù.  In the spring of 2015, fans were convinced of this personally: the album is really saturated with the atmosphere of the Northern capital - cold, painful, decadent, but at the same time lyrical, deep. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anton Boo Liss Biography" class="if" height="384" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/1330895.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><h2>  Secret of success </h2><p>  It is impossible not to note the personal merit of Anton Boo in the success and continuous creative growth of the group.  Regrettably, the domestic alternative scene, no matter how <span>sad it</span> looks and sounds, is not rich in truly gifted people - often the popularity of groups is achieved by catchy visual effects and cheap outrageous adolescents who are constantly in search of their own life channel and striving to defend their individuality, and such means as imitation of a new idol. </p><h2>  Metaphors </h2><p>  The work of Anton Lissov is undoubtedly unique: the leader of Jane Air won young hearts with sincerity, understanding and a unique musical style.  High-quality, stylistically sustained texts filled with metaphors, harsh, ragged rhythms - it is not surprising that Boo‚Äôs persona has been transformed into an archetype of Russian emo culture on the music scene. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anton Liss cause hospitalization" class="if" height="431" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1331204.jpg" width="600"></div>  Another feature that distinguishes Jane Air from other groups known among the emo movements of Russia: Anton Lissov did not become like his colleagues on the alternative scene in abusing extreme vocals, allowing fans to enjoy a well-set voice.  In numerous interviews with online publications, Boo notes that music is the only work for him that he takes seriously, despite the many commercial difficulties involved in mastering albums. <p></p><h2>  mass media </h2><p>  Talking to reporters for media stars is commonplace, but Jane Air musicians are always friendly and pleasant in conversation.  Boo &amp; Co make jokes about the planned takeover of the world and love relationships within the group, but do not forget to give serious advice to fans of their work - to look at the world with their own eyes and to maintain independent thinking. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="anton boo liss" class="if" height="480" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/19307/1330897.jpg" width="319"></div>  Despite Lissov‚Äôs frequent denials of his affiliation with emo culture, the musician apparently cannot get rid of the ‚Äúemobo‚Äù stigma.  In Anton Soy‚Äôs notorious science fiction novel ‚ÄúEmoBoy‚Äù, the main character gets to the group‚Äôs concert: ‚Äú- I am a junk!  - Screamed from the stage a pale, thin, repainted black albino Bu, dressed in all white. ‚Äù  Probably, a reference to the work of A. Lissov in the book is intended to collect all possible stereotypes about the movement of emokides in Russia, but is it so bad?  I must say that not so many popular groups and personalities are now awarded allusions in books, especially by contemporary authors. <p></p><h2>  Fiancee </h2><p>  Details of Bu's personal life were not advertised, but it is known that in the winter of 2013, Anton Lissov married Victoria Golovacheva, who works as a sales manager for Media I Group.  The musician travels a lot with his wife, regularly posting joint photos. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Anton Liss married" class="if" height="400" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/14901/1331201.jpg" width="600"></div>  Obviously, personal happiness did not affect the musician‚Äôs career in any way: our hero takes an active part in festivals both as part of the main project (Jane Air) and speaking with his daughter - Little Big - along with Sergey Makarov.  The musician notes that, despite the group‚Äôs existence (more than ten years), the collective could not draw certain lessons or conclusions.  He calls the project too young.  Currently, according <span>to the leader, the</span> team must grow stronger and learn a lot.  The musician compares the group with a child who craves sweets and gifts. <p></p><p>  Now you know who Anton Lissov is.  A photo of the musician is attached to this material. </p><p></p></div></article>
