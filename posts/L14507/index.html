<h1>Eurous.net - reviews, pay or not, how to earn</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Eurous.net reviews can be characterized as mutually exclusive: while some users have been waiting for payments for months, others receive them in full. </p><p>  The arguments against are based on the lack of contact numbers and email addresses.  In addition, the frequency of payments is suspicious.  The maximum time that separates one payment from another, according to advanced users, should not exceed 24 hours. </p><h2>  Earning without investments with a daily bonus </h2><p>  The daily dollar bonus is not the only positive difference between the Eurous.net project.  User reviews (presumably members of the affiliate program) make this platform attractive only to the eyes of inexperienced freebies.  One hundred dollars, which are issued immediately after registration on the site, enhance the effect. </p><p>  What can a newly minted financial tycoon do with this hundred dollars?  According to the participants of one of the thematic forums, money can only be distributed according to the financial platforms and options available on the platform.  Money should work. </p><h2>  The essence of earnings on eurous.net.  Pay or not? </h2><p>  One hundred dollars received during registration, scattered across financial sites, very quickly ‚Äúgrow‚Äù with interest.  Advanced users consider this to be suspicious, but no one is going to leave the site.  Out of curiosity. </p><p>  While the amounts claimed for withdrawal are ‚Äúunder processing‚Äù, experienced specialists are amused by discussing the security system and the level of protection of personal data. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.dqindia.com" data-author=": DQINDIA ONLINE, "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous financial affiliate program" class="if uuid-2359350" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359350.jpg"></div><p>  The main trump card of ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù, for example, is the absence of the https protocol on the site.  The opinion that the money earned by users of the project is unlikely to get into their wallets seems to them to be quite viable. </p><h2>  What is the https protocol? </h2><p>  So called the upgraded version of the http protocol.  It differs from its outdated prototype in that the information sent from the user computer to the server and back is protected by an advanced cipher. </p><p>  A site that hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúmoved‚Äù to https will sooner or later become an easy target for not the most enlightened, but ambitious hacker.  Typically, data interception occurs when connecting to public Wi-Fi. </p><h2>  What they say on the Web about the conditions for withdrawing earnings from Eurous.net </h2><p>  A site user will be able to transfer a hundred dollars to his virtual wallet, provided that two hundred ‚Äúbucks‚Äù accumulate in his internal account. </p><div class="photo" data-original="medium.com" data-author=": Steven Mulvey, "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous net scam" class="if uuid-2359352" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359352.jpg"></div><p>  One of the negatively-minded members of the forum - participants in the discussion of the topic: "How to make money on Eurous.net" - published his calculations on the Web.  Looking through them, it is difficult to disagree with the version of fraud. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div class="vdnow" id="vdnow"></div><p>  It turns out that if the project administrators give each person involved one dollar each day, users can earn without doing anything.  They just need to visit the breadwinner site daily. </p><p>  In anticipation of payments, users who earned several hundred dollars in October last year were unaware of how to quickly withdraw money from Eurous.net.  According to official information, the withdrawal of earned funds should be done automatically in the last days of each month. </p><p>  In fact, amounts to be withdrawn for several months were being processed.  Whether payments were made, the panelists did not report. </p><h2>  Reverse side of Eurous.net.  Are there any payments? </h2><p>  While some users waited for months for payment, others (as can be seen from the posts they left) earned money safely.  If two such different versions of what is happening safely coexist, it means that the truth, according to the unspoken rule, is somewhere in between. </p><p>  Persons who claim that the first payments were nevertheless transferred to their wallets admit that perhaps Eurous.net has ‚Äúeverything ahead‚Äù: given the age of the project, it can be assumed that it may still ‚Äúcome off‚Äù (i.e. stop making payments).  But the main reason for doubts is the lack of contact information on the site, using which the user could ask administrators questions directly to him. </p><h2>  Mysteries of the project </h2><p>  Owners of the site strongly do not fit into the already existing image of a ‚Äúfraudulent project‚Äù for one mysterious reason.  The site does not have a button "Deposit".  It is this fact that prevents the advocates of truth from adding the project to a cohort of online adventurers. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  As you know, thanks to the presence of such a button, the money of unsuspecting users comes to the scam accounts.  This, of course, is only one of many options, but still ... </p><p>  The owners of the site could shed light on this riddle if it were not for the lack of the opportunity to contact them. </p><p>  Eurous.net (user reviews of the site - evidence of this) does not encroach on the personal savings of users, but a long list of characteristic signs of fraud has been found on the Internet.  At least two points from this list can be blamed for the heroes of such exciting discussions: </p><ul><li>  The offer is drawn up ‚Äúfoggy‚Äù.  For example, it does not contain information on whether the owners of the site will be held liable if the expectations of users are not met. <div class="photo" data-original="www.onicosolutions.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous net" class="if uuid-2359358" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359358.jpg"></div></li></ul><ul><li>  The request of the administration to bring new defendants to the project indicates the opacity of the financial scheme. </li></ul><h2>  How to identify scammers operating online? </h2><p>  The most common form of <span>fraud on the Internet</span> is the so-called financial pyramid scheme.  Promising investors incredible interest and guaranteeing high returns, the ‚Äúpioneers‚Äù of this type of financial scam calculated only with a small group of investors.  They were calculated by money contributed by other investors. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dreamstime.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="how to make money on eurous net" class="if uuid-2359361" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359361.jpg"></div><p>  The promised millions could be earned by one of the first to register in the system.  Today, from the former "business" there was only the slogan - "Whoever ran first, he got rich ...".  Classic financial pyramids have long been history. </p><p>  Modern financial fraudsters prefer to disappear with the money of others, without sharing with anyone.  Therefore, today it doesn‚Äôt matter which of the depositors ‚Äúran‚Äù earlier, and which later.  Everyone will be the loser. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.motherjones.com" data-author=": NOAH LANARD, "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous net payouts" class="if uuid-2359349" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359349.jpg"></div><p>  A characteristic feature of the classical financial pyramid is that everything is "based" on logic and simple, but effective "mechanisms."  In some cases, the organizers of the pyramid do not hide from their potential participants their true intentions, focusing on the opportunities that have opened up with the advent of the World Wide Web.  However, the vast majority of online scammers prefer to keep silent about the true essence of the business they run. </p><p>  Now lovers to live at someone else's expense like to play microfinance.  For example, they are represented by non-profit (or vice versa - commercial) organizations with the right to issue loans, network companies, enterprise managers and virtual casinos. </p><p>  Often a pyramid is veiled by an investment holding.  The effect is enhanced by loud signs like: "Investment project of a new sample."  In addition to investments, such enterprises exist through the sale of bonds and other securities. </p><p>  Another common ‚Äúportrait‚Äù of a fraudster is a quasi-professional financier, ‚Äúversed in the structuring of the financial market‚Äù (or vice versa, a former unemployed person who ‚Äúwent up‚Äù in sales), eager to share his experience with everyone who wants to learn how to trade on Forex (or do something yet). </p><p>  As for the reviews of Eurous.net, users themselves admit that the administration does not even have a hint of a desire to seize other people's money.  Although the feedback from users who were not able to get ‚Äúgifts‚Äù from Eurous is full of indignation, the actions of the organizers of the project are more like an innocent rally or trick, without which it is impossible to achieve the desired. </p><h2>  Interesting details </h2><p>  Feedback from users of the site who have joined the Eurous financial partnership program suggests that the project under discussion is a kind of training site, upon registration, future business ‚Äúsharks‚Äù will gain experience in the foreign exchange markets and exchange platforms. </p><p>  According to information found on one of the partner blogs, the project unselfishly supplies each person involved with the necessary tools and tools to work with the goal of helping users increase their income. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.amarujala.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous net payments" class="if uuid-2359351" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359351.jpg"></div><p>  Let's remember how the usual withdrawal of funds on the Internet.  As a rule, this integral attribute of fraud is made out in the form of commissions that the user must pay for the withdrawal of earned funds.  Pay out of your pocket!  More precisely, transfer from a personal online wallet. </p><p>  The lack of the opportunity to replenish the account on the site under discussion, of course, discouraged active users ... But not for long.  After some deliberation, the search for the missing ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù for the picture entitled ‚ÄúEurous.net: is it a divorce or not?‚Äù Was still crowned with success.  The only selfish goal that can be attributed to the project is the desire to receive free traffic. </p><h2>  So is it worth it to work? </h2><p>  The fact that the Eurous.net project is a scam does not doubt the majority of users who have the status of "active" (actively working inside the site).  All of them are dollar millionaires.  True, only as long as they are on the site.  Applications for withdrawal, issued several months ago, are still being processed ... </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.occupy.com" data-author=": MICHAEL WINSHIP, "><img itemprop="image" alt="eurous net reviews" class="if uuid-2359347" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/44143/2359347.jpg"></div><p>  However, blaming Eurous.net owners for fraud is still difficult - they didn‚Äôt take other people's money, and not give their own money is not a crime. </p><p></p></div></article>
