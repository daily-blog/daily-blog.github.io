<h1>Imax-B6 - car battery charging: instructions, specifications, reviews</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  Drivers are required to periodically charge the <span>battery of</span> their vehicle.  For this, special devices are available for sale that can satisfy the requirements of the electrical system of a car.  However, most <span>chargers are</span> designed for a specific type of battery. </p><p>  However, in everyday life, it is sometimes necessary to use devices with various types of batteries.  In order not to buy a charger for each of them, there is a universal type of equipment.  Such devices include <span>Imax-</span> <span>B6.</span>  <span>Charging a car battery</span> , screwdriver, drill and other devices can be performed using it.  It will be interesting to learn about the main features of the presented device to each owner of the vehicle. </p><h2>  general characteristics </h2><p>  All lead-containing batteries are serviced by an <span>Imax-</span> <span>B6.</span>  <span>Charging a car battery</span> occurs both for one type of equipment, and for several at the same time.  The device is suitable for Li-Io, Li-Fe, Ni-Cd, Li-Po, Pb, Ni-MH types of batteries. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imax B6 car battery charging" class="if" height="399" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1679439.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  Also, the presented device is capable of completely discharging the listed batteries.  This allows the device to perform its actions in a fully automatic mode.  If the item is defective, charging will cut it off. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  When a certain battery capacity is reached, charging may stop.  Stopping may also occur if the battery heats up to a certain temperature.  For this, a special sensor (purchased separately) is connected to the device. </p><p>  In addition to the listed functions, Imax-B6 can balance between 2 to 6 elements.  The listed qualities make the device popular among consumers.  This is really a ‚Äúfolk‚Äù exercise. </p><h2>  Appearance </h2><p>  In order not to purchase a fake, you need to know what it looks like when delivered <span>Imax-</span> <span>B6.</span>  <span>Charging the car battery (photo</span> below) comes in a cardboard box.  In addition to the main device, the kit includes wires for connection and instructions.  The power supply in the original kit is missing. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Imax B6 mini car battery charger" class="if" height="388" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/7450/1679613.jpg" width="600"></div><p></p><p>  On the device‚Äôs body there is a connector for connecting power, as well as an output for a computer.  You can also connect a temperature sensor to it.  On the opposite side are the balancing sockets, as well as the ‚Äú+‚Äù and ‚Äú-‚Äù terminals. </p><p>  Above is a grille that simulates a radiator.  However, these ventilation slots are located on the back of the device.  Here, the original devices have a hologram of the manufacturer. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><p>  In order not to purchase a fake, these characteristic features should be paid attention to.  Due to the easy repetition of the device circuit, it is produced by other plants.  The quality of such devices, as a rule, leaves much to be desired. </p><h2>  Originality Check </h2><p>  It is necessary to verify authenticity by purchasing the original charger or its variants, for example, Imax-B6-AC (complete with power supply) or <span>Imax-</span> <span>B6 (mini).</span>  <span>Charging the car battery</span> must have a hologram from the manufacturer.

It can be purchased separately (inexpensively).  The power supply must provide a voltage of 11 to 18 volts.  A common model for 12 volts (5A) is quite suitable. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><p>  According to consumer reviews, the original kit with a power supply from the manufacturer does not work reliably enough.  Overheating occurs in the system.  Equipment for this reason quickly fails. </p><div class="photo iau"><img itemprop="image" alt="Charge your car battery with the Imax B6" class="if" height="345" src="//fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/33559/1679438.jpg" width="394"></div><p></p><p>  In the kit for connecting the power supply, the manufacturer supplies wires with connectors of the appropriate type.  There are also other cables for connecting the charger to other devices.  To enter the Imax-B6 itself, the delivery set includes wires with banana connectors.  There are also wires for connecting to the T-Connectors. </p><h2>  Manufacturer's Instruction </h2><p>  There are a number of manufacturer requirements that should be followed when operating the <span>Imax-</span> <span>B6.</span>  <span>Charging the car battery, the instruction of</span> which is included in the delivery, is carried out in accordance with certain rules.
