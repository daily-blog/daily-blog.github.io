<h1>Lilith in the synastry. The value of Lilith in the natal chart. Black Moon</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  When you read about Lilith in the synastry, it is almost impossible to find the positive aspects of her character, but modern astrologers focus on her independent nature, trying to make her story more positive, which in itself is good.  We no longer need negative or bad planets, etc. The Black Moon no longer spoils our lives.  So, applying it to modern astrology, we must objectively take into account all the available data. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.just-kiss.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilith and the dragon." class="if uuid-2910442" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910442.jpg"></div><h2>  Essence Lilith </h2><p>  Although her story is changing, there is a ‚Äúcommon theme‚Äù that accompanies this mythological figure in all tales.  In it, Lilith is exposed, to put it mildly, not the most positive character.  Therefore, referring to the positive aspects of this red-haired beast, we must bear in mind that many of her descriptions are very outdated.  At the time they were composed, people were harsh critics and moralists.  Today we are living in a time when the presence of several sexual partners or the desire of a woman to dominate is normally accepted by society, in any case, there is no reason for scandal. </p><p>  There is a possibility that in ancient legends many things can be exaggerated, because it was a much tougher time.  Today, people are much more receptive and open. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.myjewishlearning.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilith Rosetti." class="if uuid-2910443" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910443.jpg"></div><h2>  Demonic couple </h2><p>  To show how Lilith works in the synastry, it is best to choose the most demonic couple of the last century.  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton are a classic example of such a pair.  There was a tremendous passion between them, and they divorced loudly, then to converge again.  Liz Taylor was too independent for Richard Burton.  Their quarrels and conflicts became legendary, for many years they were a golden pair of Hollywood, as well as an example of two people united by the astrological influence of Lilith.  In a pair, they demonstrated both the wild and destructive energy of Lilith, and the charismatic and magnetic power of the Dark Moon.  This is their main charm. </p><h2>  Opposition of Lilith and Venus in the synastry </h2><p>  There is one very well-known aspect of Lilith, which is often opposed to Venus.  This is the aspect of the Black Moon, the lunar apogee.  Harmonious aspects Lilith between each of the partners allows them to bring magic to each other's life, adding a peppercorn to places where there is already a good sexual harmony.  In the long run, however, aspects of Lilith cannot replace the classical aspects of the synagogue of Mars and Venus. </p><p>  The Black Moon Lilith will show how tantric your sexual relationship can be and improve your sexual compatibility.  The tough aspects of personal planets can create an irresistible, intrusive mutual attraction between you - one that will mesmerize both of you.  The union of Lilith and Neptune in the synastry is what makes you leave a 30-year marriage at a whim.  This power can break the egregor of entrenched habitual behavior, but in the worst case, it really is what can be called a ‚Äúheartbreaker‚Äù - a classic home pest, a breaker of couples and hearts, a destroyer of families. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><div class="photo" data-original="www.deviantart.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Portrait of Lilith." class="if uuid-2907630" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2907630.jpg"></div><h2>  Elizabeth Taylor </h2><p>  This actress had a huge Black Moon Corridor containing the North Node, Eris, Part of Fortune, and a very tight mix of Venus and Uranus.  Not surprisingly, there is a dissonant Eris in her natal chart.  Thus, all this gave her a strong "Lilith" charm, and the conjunction of Venus and Uranus definitely explains her sparkling sexuality. </p><h2>  Planetary aspect </h2><p>  The solar conjuncture or Mercury / Lilith conjunction in the synastry receives power from the demonic and mysterious Dark Moon, which, in turn, is connected by a square to Neptune.  This dynamic, manageable, but also complex square aspect fully describes Taylor's love affair with demonic Burton, as well as her glamorous career in Hollywood.  At the top of the Zodiac there is a Dark Moon connecting two people and establishing a close relationship between them - such is the power of Lilith in the homes of partners in the synastry.  And this despite the fact that Burton was much more introverted and thoughtful than Elizabeth Taylor.  The feminist asteroid Lilith opposes the Black Moon, trying to reconcile rebellion and equality with sexual magnetism.  A typical example of such an explosive combination is the aforementioned horoscope of Elizabeth Taylor. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm01vj" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><h2>  Richard burton </h2><p>  It's time to say a few words about sweetheart Taylor.  His ‚ÄúMiddle Lilith‚Äù - a continuous triumph of Mercury, he was famous for his bewitching voice.  He, of course, had a seductive manner of speaking.  Like Elizabeth, he also has Lilith in aspect with Neptune.  His Asteroid Lilith, however, plays against him.  Because all his life he was a rebellious drunkard and a rebel. </p><p>  His Dark Moon is a semi-textile Eris, an exiled goddess with a demonic aroma.  He said that he drank because he always felt like a ‚Äúpoor boy from Wales‚Äù among the Hollywood elite.  He never felt that he really fit into their cliche.  The Dark Moon is the exiled Lilith, and Eris in the myth was an evil goddess who was not invited to the wedding.  The Dark Moon is vulnerable and vengeful, like the evil fairy of Sleeping Beauty. </p><p>  Neptune is cinema, glamor and alcoholism.  Trin Naptune with Lilith gives this actor a wounded soul, longing, imagination and the danger of error.  Lilith in the synagogue with Neptune can work on two levels: sexual education or a very unpleasant toxic relationship.  The most beautiful euphoric fantasy in this situation can dissolve in betrayal and anger. </p><div class="photo" data-original="wiki.rivalkingdomsgame.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilith in the game." class="if uuid-2910444" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910444.jpg"></div><h2>  Lilith in the aspect of Ceres </h2><p>  Ceres has her dark side, and she may experience melancholy from the pain of separation.  She can also talk about indulgence: Richard Burton, for example, was known for buying Elizabeth very extravagant jewelry.  They were rather vulgar in the manifestation of their wealth.  Ceres can be bipolar and describe the fluctuation from winter to summer in their relationship.  Trines in their meaning can speak of indulgence and laziness.  These aspects imply drunkenness with a difficult process of sobering up and regaining consciousness. </p><h2>  Lilith in the aspect of Chiron </h2><p>  The couple described in such detail in this article suffered from mutual emotional and verbal violence.  If Chiron is Jesus, and Lilith is Mary Magdalene, then this is the real equality between divine beings.  Their epic battles were a passionate battle of the sexes, and you can be sure that their relationship provided them with many opportunities for spiritual growth.  Elizabeth was a real diva at home, but when her nature of the spoiled princess grew too much, Richard threw her back to reality. </p><h2>  Dark Moon in the aspect of Mars </h2><p>  <span>Richard Burton</span> with the Dark Moon was a poor mischievous Welsh boy who did not fit into the Hollywood world and also suffered from alcoholism.  And Elizabeth was, on the contrary, spoiled and self-confident.  The conjuncture is a difficult aspect, and in their regular synastry they had a very complex opposition between Mars and Saturn, which negatively affected relations. </p><h2>  In Aspect of Asteroid Lilith </h2><p>  The position of the asteroid Lilith for these two was also very different, and this is a double blow to family well-being.  The combination of magical, sexual, glamorous and combative, rebellious energy that they generated among themselves is very closely connected with the Sun / Lilith conjunction in the synastry.  They were known in the 60s, reflecting the tension in the world in the sexual revolution, reinforced by the union of Uranus and Pluto. </p><h2>  The value of Lilith in the natal chart </h2><p>  You can take Burton's natal chart as a good example, because he has all 3 Liliths that are very active.  Starting with the basics.  Is there Lilith in the aspect of the ascendant or the descent?  At least in the birth chart he has a square of the Sun.  His Moon is delineated by Lilith's Black Moon, which makes him and Taylor the classic Lilith couple. </p><p>  These selfless people somehow escape from respect and adoration, combined with the fact that they themselves have become the embodiment of taboos, expelled and demonized people in Hollywood.  Sometimes people with Lilith in the natal chart begin their lives as favorites of the public, suppressing their eccentricity, and then start to move incredibly to their more authentic "I", suddenly provoking universal hatred.  This, of course, describes this pair very well.  Amy Winehouse had the same thing - so she probably had problems with drug addiction and an obsessive, hectic love life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="kartermods.blogspot.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="White-haired Lilith." class="if uuid-2910445" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910445.jpg"></div><h2>  Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton: Synastry </h2><p>  Not surprisingly, for such a stellar pair, their natal chart has great geometry with many aspects.  Small and great trines are considered gifts of fate for their relationship.  They have the glamor of Neptune and the sexuality of Mars, both of them indicate voluptuous and fertile Ceres, all this testifies to their great success as a Hollywood couple.  Trigon fully describes the magic that they obtained when they shone on the screen. </p><p>  At the same time, this pattern was also the cause of their problems with drug addiction.  The severe aspects of Mars / Neptune are usually found in alcoholics, this is a mild aspect, but Mars receives a square from Eris, which makes it bitter and raging.  Eris is also associated with benign Neptune.  Neptune in terms of Ceres is also another exciting aspect, as they both strive to be something more.  Ceres administers Neptune's herbs / opiates and spirits.  Both of these drugs are notable for dissolving boundaries. </p><p>  If you look at your natal chart, then pay attention to Eris - it plays an important role in pulling out the secondary great trigon into what some call the ‚Äúmodel‚Äù aspect.  A model is a prototype that allows us to understand the final product of astrological forecasting on a larger scale.  This is an example of the expression "In the great as well as in the small."  Richard and Elizabeth were selected to consider the effects of each person‚Äôs toxic relationship on the whole family.  Richard and Liz have become almost synonymous with describing the eternal battle of the sexes, where a man and a woman converge in a battle for primacy in a relationship. </p><h2>  Sextile </h2><p>  If they solved their problems with alcohol, Neptune might have smoothed out their fiery synastry and raised it to a higher level.  Sextile Mars-Ceres delights, as does the raw sexuality of Mars, refined by the sensual Ceres.  Ceres is also a conjunct of Jupiter, which describes their abundant, tasteless, and sometimes quite vulgar manifestation of wealth.  So very often the Jupiter / Lilith conjunction appears in the synastry.  Richard gifted Liz with unusually expensive jewelry, the most famous of which is a 69 carat diamond from Taylor &amp; Burton. </p><div class="photo" data-original="35photo.pro" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilith with a veil." class="if uuid-2910446" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910446.jpg"></div><h2>  Asteroid Lilith and the Dark Moon </h2><p>  Contacts with Lilith Asteroid can show where there is a power struggle in a pair, regardless of whether a person accepts equality in his partner or not.  If there are serious aspects between them, this can mean anything: from bickering over the fact that someone is wearing pants incorrectly, to real domestic violence.  Harmonious aspects can show where the features of this pair manifest, eccentric or strange.  For example, they can play their battles for equality in the role-playing bedroom. </p><p>  By the example of Taylor and Burton, we have already seen that they have an Asteroid Lilith in a double bundle with the Black Moon, which only enhances their marriage battles.  In their natal chart, we have the Asteroid Lilith connecting Saturn.  Saturn is often associated with patriarchal values.  The rebellious asteroid Lilith will always have problems with the heavy authority of Saturn trying to suppress it. </p><p>  Studying the Black Moon, Lilith will reveal the "devils in the pool" and the hidden rage that undermines relations from within.  The couple can improve the situation by combining passion in joint creative projects, increasing energy to a higher vibration.  The ego needs to be put aside to do something in common, and it really helps.  Otherwise, the worst-case scenario would be that Lilith‚Äôs unsuccessful placement will manifest as vengeful behavior, sadomasochism, seething anger and sexual and psychological violence.  These are generally the features of Lilith - she patronizes marginality, drugs, cunning, quickness, promiscuous sexual intercourse and temptation. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.imdb.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Lilith in the movie." class="if uuid-2910447" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/90445/2910447.jpg"></div><h2>  Role of pluto </h2><p>  Their square or Pluto / Lilith conjunction in the synastry creates many difficulties, because Pluto is a planet of manipulation and dark domination.  Fortunately, this is not a very difficult square, but in combination with all other stressful aspects, to put it mildly, it does not help smooth out the situation, especially if you recall the problems with alcohol and inequality in pairs.  There is a high probability that this bad square will cause a person to abuse something.  Mars Taylor is connected to Burton's Dark Moon in their synastry, which only exacerbated his personal demons. </p><h2>  The relationship of astrology and tarot cards </h2><p>  In Tarot cards, Lilith patronizes the Moon card.  This card corresponds to the Dark side of the Moon, the unconscious, nightmares, the Oedipus complex and incest in the narrow sense of the word.  In the Tarot, this card is considered one of the most terrible and dangerous, as it is associated with illusions, delusions and self-deception. </p><p></p></div></article>
