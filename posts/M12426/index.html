<h1>Tattoos of the symbols of loneliness, their meaning</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The symbolism on the body can not only decorate the skin and distinguish the owner from the crowd, but also bring new events and moments to his life.  Tattoos of symbols of loneliness became popular several years ago, but now more and more people want to make a symbolic sketch for themselves.  This type of tattoo is considered one of the strangest, because it can bring the owner a lot of trouble. </p><div class="photo" data-original="thewildtattoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="image of bird" class="if uuid-2741337" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2741337.jpg"></div><h2>  Symbol Value </h2><p>  These symbols are considered ideal for people who are trying to retire from the world and distance themselves from others.  Although the symbol of loneliness itself can be quite attractive and stylish, its effect on human life is felt quite quickly. </p><p>  Most often they stuff themselves a red poppy.  This beautiful juicy flower attracts with its appearance, but its meaning is to express loneliness and detachment from the problems of the world.  The flower is chosen by sentimental, proud and proud personalities who want to emphasize their status. </p><p>  The symbol of loneliness looks especially beautiful on women.  The tattoo will be tender on the wrist or ankle in the form of a bracelet that gently envelops the skin.  Also, small tattoos can fill on the foot or neck.  Large-scale sketches of the master can be performed on the forearm or back, but not one character is used here, but a whole plot, in which additional elements can be woven. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-0.612075761975234" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  To perform tattoos, red pigment is used to emphasize the beauty and attractiveness of the flower, its juiciness and volume.  The stalk can even be depicted with black pigment to create contrast. </p><h2>  Wolf sign </h2><p>  Another symbol of loneliness, popular among males, is the wolf.  This is an attribute of fidelity and monogamy, confidence in one‚Äôs position and unwillingness to let strangers in. </p><div class="photo" data-original="fittingtattoo.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="drawing of the beast" class="if uuid-2741342" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2741342.jpg"></div><p>  Depending on how the beast is depicted, we can talk about an additional meaning.  If a wolf howls against the background of the moon, then this is a symbol of sadness and loss of a loved one.  When a wolf is moving in the background of a forest, this is the position of a person who does not want to share himself with others, he is comfortable in his loneliness. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.dubuddha.org" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="wolf sign" class="if uuid-2741341" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2741341.jpg"></div><p>  In ancient Egypt, the <span>wolf</span> tattoo <span>symbolized</span> Anubis, a brave god who carried mystery and power.  It is a connection with death and other worlds.  Each culture has in itself a symbol of the wolf, the main meaning of which is to reveal the strength, confidence of a person and his uniqueness.  This is how the meaning of a tattoo can be interpreted through an image. </p><div id="sjcont" style="display: none;"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-0.612075761975234" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-3"></div><h2>  Bird symbol </h2><p>  A popular tattoo - a symbol of loneliness, is considered an owl.  It is also a combination in one image of detachment, the desire to be lonely and inner evil throughout one's life.  Although, on the other hand, an owl is considered a symbol of wisdom and experience. </p><p>  The meaning of a tattoo depends on the background and additional elements that emphasize the sacred meaning.  A majestic and proud bird can mean internal anxiety, sadness or loss of a loved one.  An owl on the background of the moon will express a life position and a conscious choice of loneliness and existence without a couple. </p><p>  A symbol of loneliness - an <span>owl tattoo</span> - also means a reluctance to let others around him.  This is a favorite sign of introverts and people who are comfortable being away from others.  A universal symbol that can be applied to both men and women.  The tattoo looks good in color, when the emphasis is on the big smart eyes of the bird. </p><h2>  Mystery of the raven </h2><p>  Another bird symbolizing sadness, loneliness and estrangement from the world.  A raven sitting on a branch denotes a person who has lost his life path and is now waiting for the right moment to adapt again in this world.  If the branch is black and the background is also in depressing colors, then a person cannot find himself for a long time, he simply lost the meaning of life. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.pinterest.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="raven symbol" class="if uuid-2741339" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/94074/2741339.jpg"></div><p>  It also happens when a crow is depicted against a light background, which means the end of the dark period in life and the beginning of a new light streak.  <span>The symbol of the raven</span> is also self-improvement and hope for a new day. </p><p>  A raven on a branch or just a bird‚Äôs profile is inflicted on a man‚Äôs forearm, back or arms.  In terms of energy, these places are considered indicators of strength, so they are often used to apply different symbols. </p><h2>  Additional Attributes </h2><p>  Sometimes the symbol itself is not enough to convey its full meaning.  Then additional elements are applied.  The symbol of the sign of loneliness is the full moon.  The animals depicted on its background also embody sadness and a desire to be further from everyone, alone with oneself. </p><p>  Branches, fading flowers are also considered attributes of a lonely person.  They symbolize the remnants of the material world, which still holds the body, but cannot completely affect the spirit and mind of the individual.  Sharp objects such as knives, swords, arrows can also be used.  Their direction will indicate possible changes in the future and a change in the mood of a person, his desire to find the ultimate goal. </p><p>  Tattoo symbols of loneliness can be applied to any area or part of the body, depending on the wishes of the person.  This is not only a stylish attribute, but also a sacred sign of expression of the human inner world. </p><p></p></div></article>
