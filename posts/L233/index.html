<h1>Bite the lip: signs and superstitions. What does it mean to expect and whether to believe the signs?</h1><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" class="article .page"><div id="content" class="pagedata"><p>  The sign <span>"Bite the lip" that does</span> not lose its relevance <span>.</span>  What is she talking about?  To answer this question, you need to understand the details.  Did this happen while chatting or eating?  Lower or upper lip?  Or maybe bite in a dream and want to understand what it is?  Answers can be found on almost all questions. </p><h2>  Omens </h2><p>  It is easier to believe in them if they promise good, and I want to quickly slip through if they promise bad.  But with those signs that I heard about, but really do not know the meaning, the most difficult.  But, as they say, knowledge is better than ignorance.  Therefore, we will try to reveal the meaning of signs with a bitten lip in different circumstances. </p><div class="photo" data-original="megastyle.ph" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bit her lip" class="if uuid-2493146" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84595/2493146.jpg"></div><h2>  During conversation </h2><p>  If during a fascinating conversation you bit your lip, it means that you were in a hurry to convey some information and see the interlocutor‚Äôs reaction to it.  The sign says that it is necessary to slow down, you need to take into account and listen to your vis-a-vis, and also weigh your words before expressing them. </p><p>  There is another decoding of the sign: the speaker is dissatisfied with what is happening now, but does not realize this report, therefore his body is forced to signal this explicitly.  It can also be a signal to stop empty communication. </p><div><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-cuiwcdj54" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="NRent-5ced10a04aa78-2"></div><p>  And if the interlocutor bit his lip, then it is worth paying a close look at him.  By <span>acceptance, this</span> means that he says too much, which was not supposed to be told to you.  Either holds a grudge that he is trying to restrain, or you touched on a topic that was painful for him.  In any case, pay attention to the topic of conversation in which this reaction slipped.  You will have to work in her direction to understand the reasons for what happened. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.vulture.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bite in doubt" class="if uuid-2493135" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84595/2493135.jpg"></div><p>  Of course, this may not be a sign at all.  Everyone can bite their lower lip, it only says that the person is very passionate about what he is talking about.  Understanding which of the following values ‚Äã‚Äãapplies to your situation will help the analysis of all the signs from the interlocutor in communication.  For example, if he is open and communicates freely, then we are talking about excitement and emotionality.  If he is restrained and prudent, then most likely his involuntary biting of his lips means something serious. </p><h2>  While eating </h2><p>  If you are alone with yourself, you bit your lip while eating, the sign says that you have a great kiss ahead.  Another superstition with this key is: if during the day you bite your lip every now and then, soon very long passionate kisses await you. </p><div id="sjcont"><sjdiv id="SlickJumpNative-sm00vk" prerender=""></sjdiv></div><div id="inpage" style="position: relative;"></div><p>  This sign was not born by chance: if kissing for a long time, blood rushes to the lips, they blush and swell.  When bitten, the same effect is manifested.  So in theory, the omen can be turned in the opposite direction: bite your lips to bring hot kisses to life.  Even in ancient times, beauties resorted to all kinds of tricks to make their lips brighter. </p><div class="photo" data-original="imgur.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bit her lip" class="if uuid-2493138" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84595/2493138.jpg"></div><p>  If your interlocutor bit his lower lip while eating, the omen says that he has negative intentions towards you.  It can be both fleeting thoughts, and resentment, and anger.  They can even result in actions directed at you. </p><h2>  Top or bottom </h2><p>  Regular nibbling of the lower lip suggests that you are an indecisive person.  This can mean stiffness, hesitation in making decisions, long doubts and weighing in discussions about the past.  If you usually bite your lip from the inside, the sign does not mean indecision, but a very pleasant surprise that will fall on you in the near future. </p><p>  A very <span>good sign</span> is to bite your lip, especially if it is upper.  You are waiting for a family holiday or a very joyful event.  And also, accidentally biting the upper lip is an attempt to cope with feelings in relation to some person.  So if there is such a person in your company, it is quite possible that he is breathing unevenly towards someone around him. </p><div class="photo" data-original="dreamingandsleeping.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bite your tongue" class="if uuid-2493143" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84595/2493143.jpg"></div><h2>  In a dream </h2><p>  What if you bit your lip in a dream?  According to various sources, a dream with a bitten lip comes when a person regrets what he said in reality and that he did not restrain himself in communication.  Such a sign indicates the need to reconsider life priorities. </p><p>  Generally speaking, biting the lip happens in emotional moments.  It can be excitement, fear, irritation.  Or in situations of containment, when you can‚Äôt or don't want to say too much.  You need to be attentive to yourself and your surroundings and notice the body language: this will help you see the picture more fully and understand more correctly, both yourself and your opponent. </p><p>  The main thing is that after all these unrest, the habit of biting your lip does not stay with you, because then it will have to be replaced with something else.  The reason for biting the lip can also be purely physiological - an incorrect bite, an uneven dentition, or a poor denture.  In this case, you need to contact the doctors, and signs have nothing to do with it. </p><div class="photo" data-original="www.rd.com" data-author=": "><img itemprop="image" alt="Bite your lip in a dream" class="if uuid-2493145" src="https://fb.ru/misc/i/gallery/84595/2493145.jpg"></div><h2>  What to do </h2><p>  In fact, regardless of whether it is a malocclusion or other pathology in the mouth of a physical nature, it develops into an even bigger problem over time.  Therefore, if during a meal or in a conversation a biting of the lip occurs with enviable regularity, then the following actions must be carried out: </p><ul><li>  Rinse your mouth with warm water or a disinfectant solution. </li><li>  Drink warm tea or broth, green leaf tea or chamomile and St. John's wort are well suited. </li><li>  Avoid using medications containing alcohol; this will burn your delicate oral cavity. </li><li>  If possible, you need to attach something cold to the damaged area.  For example, if you bite your cheek, then apply ice from the outside - this will slightly relieve the pain. </li><li>  In the case of infrequent and minor injuries, do not worry: such wounds are easily treated simply with saliva, which also has a disinfecting effect.  However, if the damage does not pass after two days or even increases in size, you should consult a doctor. </li></ul><p>  No need to treat superstitions as law or inevitability.  However, passing them past the ears is also unreasonable.  The best way to notice signs, be aware of what they saw, but be guided by common sense. </p><p>  Every day we send each other many signs - some are veiled, others are direct, but most of them simply go unnoticed.  The most correct way would be to read and accept the useful and encouraging (which is good by definition), and also not to close our eyes to psychology and the physical world with its laws. </p><p></p></div></article>
